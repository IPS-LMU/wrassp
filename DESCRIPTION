Description: wrassp is a wrapper around Michel Scheffers's libassp (Advanced
    Speech Signal Processor). The libassp library aims at providing
    functionality for handling speech signal files in most common audio formats
    and for performing analyses common in phonetic science/speech science. This
    includes the calculation of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean
    square, auto correlation, a variety of spectral analyses, zero crossing
    rate, filtering etc. This wrapper provides R with a large subset of
    libassp's signal processing functions and provides them to the user in a
    (hopefully) user-friendly manner.
