## Out of funding

Unfortunately, the EMU-SDMS is currently out of funding.

We at the IPS will do what we can to fix bugs, security issues or necessary adjustments to new versions of R; but we cannot currently work on new features or performance improvements.

We would be very glad if funding in academia allowed for more technical staff to maintain software used by the research community.

## Introduction

`wrassp` is a wrapper for R around Michel Scheffers's [libassp](http://libassp.sourceforge.net/)
(Advanced Speech Signal Processor). The libassp library aims at providing functionality for handling speech signal files in most common audio formats and for performing analyses common in phonetic science/speech science. This includes the calculation of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean square, auto correlation, a variety of spectral analyses, zero crossing rate, filtering etc. This wrapper provides R with a large subset of libassp's signal processing functions and provides them to the user in a (hopefully) user-friendly manner.

This package is part of the next iteration of the EMU Speech Database Management System which aims to be as close to an all-in-one solution for generating, manipulating, querying, analyzing and managing speech databases as possible. For an overview of the system please visit this URL: [https://ips-lmu.github.io/EMU.html](https://ips-lmu.github.io/EMU.html).

## Installation

* install the current [CRAN release](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wrassp):
```r
install.packages("wrassp")
```

* or install the latest development version from GitHub (as large parts of `wrassp` are written in `C` make sure your system fulfills the requirements for package development (see [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites))):
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("IPS-LMU/wrassp", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Quick start

* load the library: 
```r
library("wrassp")
```

* get path to an audio file: 
```r
path2wav <- list.files(system.file("extdata", package = "wrassp"), pattern = glob2rx("*.wav"), full.names = TRUE)[1]
```

* calculate formants from audio file: 
```r
res=forest(path2wav, toFile=FALSE)
```

* plot the first 100 F1 values over time: 
```r
plot(res$fm[1:100,1],type='l')
```

* for more information see the `An introduction to the wraspp package` vignette: 
```r
vignette('wrassp_intro')
```


## Available signal processing functions

+ `acfana()`: Analysis of short-term autocorrelation function
+ `afdiff()`: Computes the first difference of the signal
+ `affilter()`: Filters the audio signal (see docs for types)
+ `cepstrum()`: Short-term cepstral analysis
+ `cssSpectrum()`: Cepstral smoothed version of `dftSpectrum()`
+ `dftSpectrum()`: Short-term DFT spectral analysis
+ `forest()`: Formant estimation
+ `ksvF0()`: F0 analysis of the signal
+ `lpsSpectrum()`: Linear Predictive smoothed version of `dftSpectrum()`
+ `mhsF0()`: Pitch analysis of the speech signal using Michel's/Modified Harmonic Sieve algorithm
+ `rfcana()`: Linear Prediction analysis
+ `rmsana()`: Analysis of short-term Root Mean Square amplitude
+ `zcrana()`: Analysis of the averages of the short-term positive and negative zero-crossing rates

(see the respective R documentation for more details on all of these functions)

## Available file handling functions

+ `read.AsspDataObj()`: read an existing SSFF file into a `AsspDataObj` which is its in-memory equivalent.
+ `write.AsspDataObj()`: write a `AsspDataObj` out to a SSFF file.

## For Developers

### Checking on rocker/r-devel docker image (prerequisite docker is installed)

- pull current r-devel image: `docker pull rocker/r-devel`
- check if pull worked: `docker images`
- check R version in image: `docker run rocker/r-devel:latest R --version`
- run interactive version of bash and mount wrassp project folder (==current directory): `docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/wrassp rocker/r-devel:latest bash`
- build: `RD CMD build --resave-data --no-manual --no-build-vignettes wrassp`
- manually install deps (this might need a bit of tweaking): `RD -e 'install.packages(c("stringi","evaluate","compare", "rmarkdown", "knitr", "testthat"))'`
- check: `RD CMD check --as-cran wrassp_*.tar.gz`


### Using rchk for additional checks

- clone repo `git clone https://github.com/joshuaulrich/rchk-docker.git`
- `cd rchk-docker`
- build docker image `docker build .`
- code below is adapted from final example of this `README.md`: https://github.com/kalibera/rchk
- build r package `./bin/R CMD build --resave-data --no-manual --no-build-vignettes /wrassp`
- install package `echo 'install.packages("wrassp_0.1.5.tar.gz",repos=NULL)' |  ./bin/R --slave`
- run rchk `/opt/rchk/scripts/check_package.sh wrassp`
- view rchk results `less packages/lib/wrassp/libs/wrassp.so.bcheck` and `less packages/lib/wrassp/libs/wrassp.so.maacheck`
